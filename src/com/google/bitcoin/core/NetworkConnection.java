 * A NetworkConnection handles talking to a remote BitCoin peer at a low level. It understands how to read and write
 * messages off the network, but doesn't asynchronously communicate with the peer or handle the higher level details
 * of the protocol. After constructing a NetworkConnection, use a {@link Peer} to hand off communication to a
 * background thread.<p>
 *
 * Multiple NetworkConnections will, by default, wait if another NetworkConnection instance is deserializing a
 * message and discard duplicates before reading them. This is intended to avoid memory usage spikes in constrained
 * environments like Android where deserializing a large message (like a block) on multiple threads simultaneously is
 * both wasteful and can cause OOM failures.<p>
 *
 * Construction is blocking whilst the protocol version is negotiated.
