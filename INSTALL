=====================================
Bitventory.com Browser Signing Applet
=====================================

Installation
------------

For easy compilation, run the following from the root directory:

    ./build.sh

This will create the applet as: MyBitventoryApplet.jar

NOTE: This script pulls down pre-compiled dependencies. This
includes the Bouncy Castle crypto library for Java as well as
the Simple Logging Facade 4 Java.

If you wish to compile these yourself, please visit:

	http://www.bouncycastle.org/latest_releases.html

	http://www.slf4j.org/download.html

You will need to compile and place their classes in lib/org/

For convenience, plugin.jar (used for Java->Javascript
communication) is included as well, but you may copy it
from your system into the project directory to use it.

For information about how to sign and use this applet
with the Bitventory.com service, please login to your
