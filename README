=====================================
Bitventory.com Browser Signing Applet
=====================================

Description
-----------

The Bitventory.com Browser Signing Applet is a tool accessed by the Bitventory
web application to perform operations needed to run an online wallet. This applet
lets the user retain control of transaction signing, key generation, and other
sensitive operations.

By offloading these methods to outside, auditable code that the user can swap
in, Bitventory allows the user to fully control the code used to perform
critical functions on the site. In this manner, the site operator
or any malicious third party that gains unauthorized access to the site
will be unable to steal funds from accounts.

It is hoped that users, or members of the Bitcoin community, will
audit this code and let others know that particular revisions of the
code on Github are safe. As the applet should NOT be frequently updated,
this means the current head of the repository should be trustworthy.

Requirements
------------

This README assumes you're using a POSIX-compliant system such as a
GNU/Linux distribution of some sort (Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, etc). If
you're using Windows, you'll need to obtain a package called Cygwin

If you'd like to contribute information on how to use this tool
with Cygwin on Windows systems, please send me a pull request.

To install the tool, please see INSTALL in the source directory.

Once the jar file is compiled and ready, you'll need to upload
it to a web host and add that URL to your Bitventory settings
page. For details on how to do this as well as how to generate
keys and sign your own jar, please check the "Source" page
